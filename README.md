** Hello there!**

I am a backend developer with 5 years of experience.  I started my backend development journey with JAVA, Spring Boot, and RDB, and have since expanded my expertise to include Typescript, NestJS, NoSQL, and GraphQL. I am passionate about building sustainable software that is highly scalable, maintainable, and reliable. (I love clean code and clean architecture!) I aspire to contribute to business growth and direction, cost reduction, and user retention by creating sustainable software. âœ¨ In my free time, I enjoy riding motorcycles and spending time with my dog.
