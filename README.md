  ðŸ‘‹&nbsp; Hello there! I'm <b>backend developer</b> with 5 years of experience.ðŸš€<br/>
  I started my backend development journey with JAVA, Spring Boot, and RDB, and have since expanded my expertise to include Typescript, NestJS, NoSQL, and GraphQL.<br/>
  I am passionate about building sustainable software that is highly scalable, maintainable, and reliable. (I love clean code and clean architecture!)<br/>
 I aspire to contribute to business growth and direction, cost reduction, and user retention by creating sustainable software. âœ¨<br/><br/>
   In my free time, I enjoy riding motorcycles and spending time with my dog.<br/>
